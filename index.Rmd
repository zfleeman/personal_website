My name is Zach Fleeman. I am a data scientist in the Denver/Boulder, Colarado Metropolitan Area. I'm almost 6'2" tall.

I hold a [Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Analytics](http://ww2.rockhurst.edu/helzberg/msbia) from the Helzberg School of Management at Rockhurst University along with a [Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering](http://engineering.missouri.edu/imse/) from the University of Missouri. I love working with data and people.

I work as a data scientist at Oracle Data Cloud during the day, and I am always looking for ways to learn new things and expand my body of work. Send inquiries to zfleeman@gmail.com.

This website houses my online works and personal blog. I write a whole lot of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code, so I decided to recreate my website using a combination of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents. I'm hosting this page statically on an AWS S3 Bucket. Please browse the links in the navbar up top. ~~Some~~ Most of them bring you to my external profiles.

When I'm done being traditionally productive, I am probably running or capturing video game footage for my YouTube channel.
